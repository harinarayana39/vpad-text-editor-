The aim of text editors is to edit text. Computer programs, web pages, web apps, and a great many other things are built out of text. Text editors are also popular for writers who don’t want to risk vendor lock-in. Text is open, easily searchable, and future proof.

When it comes to text editors, there are common features that they all share. It’s what makes a text editor a text editor. Here are a few:

*Easy to use and navigate (similar to a good word processor)

*Find and replace feature (so you can change a single word in the whole file with a few clicks)

*Cut, Copy, Paste (again, similar to word processors)

*Ability to handle UTF-8 encoded text (also unlike a word processor)

*Syntax highlighting (unlike your word processor, this makes it easier to read code and pick up any errors)

*Customizable appearance (such as modifying font size, color schemes, etc., of your editor which optimizes your work zone)

*Extensibility – (provide some plugin mechanism, or is scriptable, so a programmer can customize the editor with additional features – this is more advanced)
